Format of the Test Configuration File
=====================================

The tests are configured in the file `config.json`.

TODO: Describe the header and test vectors

## Scripts

The configuration file can specify a number of `scripts`. Each script describes a particular scenario of a group's evolution, specified as a sequence of **actions** (e.g. sending a proposal).

### Actors
Each action is performed by an **actor** (e.g. alice). At each point in time, each actor has at most one MLS client who participates in at most one MLS session. A client and a session for an actor are created in one of two ways:

1. When the actor executes the `createGroup` action, a client with a session is created.
2. When the actor executes the `createKeyPackage` action, a client without a session is created. When later the actor executes the joinGroup action, a session for the client is created.

Note: Creating a new client / session silently overwrites the first one.


### Actions

Each action must specify two values: `action` indicating the action type (e.g. `removeProposal`) and `actor` identifying the actor performing the action. Some actions require additional values, e.g., the leaf index of a removed member or a pointer to a packet generated as a result of a previous action. A pointers to the outcome of a previous action is always its index in the sequence of all actions in the given script.

The outputs of all actions are logged in the transcript. They can be either packets packets sent to the delivery service (logged as hex-encoded bytes) or values outputted to the user (stored as strings). The transcript is printed to STDOUT.


The following actions are supported.


| `action`             | Values specified by the action in addition to `actor` and `action` | Output values stored in the transcript | Description                                       |
|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| `createGroup`        | -                                          | -                             | A new client for the `actor` and a new group with themselves in it are created.      |
| `createKeyPackage`   | -                                          | `keyPackage`: packet                   | A new client for the `actor` and a new key package for them are created.      |
| `addProposal`        | `keyPackage`: int                          | `proposal`: packet               | The `actor`’s current client sends a proposal that adds a member with the key package created during the `createKeyPackage` action with index `keyPackage`. |
| `removeProposal`     | `removed`: string                          | `proposal`: packet               | The `actor`’s current client sends a proposal that removes the actor indicated in `removed`. |
| `updateProposal`     | -                                          | `proposal`: packet               | The `actor`’s current client sends an update. |
| `commit`             | `byReference`: []int                       | `commit`: packet, `welcome`: packet | The `actor`’s current client first processes the proposals created during actions identified by the indices in the list `byReference` and then they send a commit. The `byReference` list MUST NOT include proposals from `actor` (those should be committed automatically). |
| `handleCommit`       | `commit`: int, `byReference`: []int        | `stateUpdate` (see below)                  | The `actor`’s current client first processes the proposals created during actions with indices specified in `byReference`. Then it processes the commit created during the `commit` action with index `commit` which includes them by reference. The `byReference` list MUST NOT include proposals created by `actor`. The `commit` MUST NOT have been created by `actor`.
| `handlePendingCommit`| -                                          | `stateUpdate` (see below)                  | The `actor`’s current client accepts the commit it sent. |
| `joinGroup`          | `welcome`: int                        | [TODO]                        | The `actor`’s current client joins the group using the welcome message created during the `commit` action index `welcome`. This creates a new session.
| `protect`            | `applicationData`: string                  | `ciphertext`: packet             | The `actor`’s current client encrypts given data, given as b64 encoded bytes. |
| `unprotect`          | `ciphertext`: int                          | `applicationData`: hex encoded bytes              | The `actor`’s current client decrypts the ciphertext created during the `protect` action with index `ciphertext`. The message MUST NOT have been generated by the actor. |

A `stateUpdate` outputted after processing a commit is a list consisting of zero or more of the following items. Here `i` is always an integer used to make keys unique.

* Key `added[i]`, value `leafIndex` denotes that a member was added and now has given `leafIndex`.
* Key `updated[i]`, value `leafIndex` denotes that an update from a member with given `leafIndex` was applied.
* Key `removedIndex[i]`, value `leafIndex` followed by key `removedLeaf[i]`, value `leafNode` denotes that a member who had given `leafIndex` was removed and his leaf node (no longer in the tree) used to be `leafNode` (represented as TLS-serialized hex-encoded bytes).
* Key `psks[i]`, value `pskId` denotes that a PSK with given `pskId` was mixed into the key schedule. The value `pskId` includes all data from `PreSharedKeyID` except `nonce`. It is TLS-serialized and hex-encoded.
